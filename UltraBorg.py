"""
This module is designed to communicate with the UltraBorg

Use by creating an instance of the class, call the Init function, then command as desired, e.g.
import UltraBorg
UB = UltraBorg.UltraBorg()
UB.Init()
# User code here, use UB to control the board

Multiple boards can be used when configured with different I²C addresses by creating multiple instances, e.g.
import UltraBorg
UB1 = UltraBorg.UltraBorg()
UB2 = UltraBorg.UltraBorg()
UB1.i2cAddress = 0x44
UB2.i2cAddress = 0x45
UB1.Init()
UB2.Init()
# User code here, use UB1 and UB2 to control each board separately

For explanations of the functions available call the Help function, e.g.
import UltraBorg
UB = UltraBorg.UltraBorg()
UB.Help()

worked = SetWithRetry(setFunction, getFunction, value, count)

Attempts to write a value multiple times before giving up
Pass a set function with one parameter, and a get function no parameters
The get function will be used to check if the set worked, if not it will be repeated
e.g.
worked = SetWithRetry(UB.SetServoMinimum1, UB.GetServoMinimum1, 2000, 5)
Will try UB.SetServoMinimum1(2000) upto 5 times, returning when UB.GetServoMinimum1 returns 2000.
Useful for ensuring a write is successful
